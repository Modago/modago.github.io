I am relatively calm person with a dream to make the world a better place, but sometimes lacking the fortitude to continuously pursue the dream ðŸ™‚. I enjoy being of service to others and never pass up an opportunity to help if I can. All in all, I am a confused â€¦ year old trying to find his place in the world a smile at a time. After years of contemplation (and starting and stopping one or two personal blogs), it was about time to have a place to share thoughts, learn, test ideas and along the way maybe educate one or two! I earned my PhD in information processing science from the University of Oulu in the Spring of 2018. Currently, I work part-time as a post-doctoral researcher at the OASIS research unit in the Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Oulu. My research is about the design of persuasive systems, understanding human behaviour and how technology influences and can be used to change/shape human behaviour for the better. My research interests include: Persuasive systems (design) and behaviour change. Use and adoption of digital services. Understanding users' decision-making processes and psychological aspects of change. Identifying ways in which technology could address the needs of the marginalised and designing digital interventions to cater to these needs. Other interests: Social Network Analysis. Location-based social media analysis Principles and applications of digital fabrication All the files for the assignments can be found in my Gitlab account. Hobbies Football has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. As with my dream of making the world a better place, I haven't had the fortitude to pursue football beyond the amateur level and my time is now long gone (if there ever was such a time ðŸ˜Œ). In addition to football and following other sports like athletics, I enjoy playing scrabble and at times chess (but it has been a while since I played chess), listening to music (at times very loudly), reading (mostly psychological, design and business-related books, but I can pretty much read anything), writing (when the motivation strikes!), occasionally binge-watching tv programmes and generally meeting people. I also enjoy participating in voluntary activities. I have been part of clubs and associations such as Rotaract in Kenya and AIESEC at the university of Oulu which focus on teamwork, members' personal development and community service. In addition to volunteering for Plan Finland and participating in several community engagement events, for Plan and other associations throughout the years.

For example, it is now possible to independently and remotely learn (a new language or subject), monitor our health or wellbeing, become greener and more energy efficient, save money, overcome an addiction, and so forth through the use of different technological services. As our lives have increasingly become intertwined with technology, studying how our everyday actions are influenced by our interactions with technology and how we can achieve positive and sustainable behaviour change through the use of various technological services is of utmost importance. With the many opportunities technology now avails, it is important to investigate how to design and develop appropriate solutions that fulfill users' needs and how this impacts users' livelihoods. It is not only about individual users interacting with technology, but also how they adapt their interactions with one another using technology as a medium. An overarching theme in my research has been studying how individuals understand their interactions with technology and their perceptions on the efficacy of different technological interventions. Further, my research examines how systems design can facilitate user engagement and influence behaviour. I use an interdisciplinary approach to address research questions by integrating literature from Information Systems , Social Psychology , Behavioural Economics and Human-Computer Interaction that explain systems adoption and use practices, decision making and user behaviour in different contexts. Theories from these support design practices and can help in outlining systems design requirements. PhD Research My PhD research focused on behaviour change and the design of persuasive systems. The design of systems to help users meet their health, productivity, learning and other objectives without deception or coercion. This included investigating systems use, user perceptions of these systems and the factors that lead to continued use of behaviour change support systems (BCSSs). I also examined user commitments, the factors that affect users' decision making and proposed techniques for improving the development of BCSSs. As my research is about behaviour change through technology, it was important to study users' needs and the broader implications of applying different systems design approaches to meet these needs. The dissertation's main aim was to investigate how the design of persuasive systems could be improved. The dissertation consisted of a literature review, two quantitative studies, and two constructive studies that outlined the use of software design patterns to develop BCSSs. The research suggested that users have different preferences and perceptions on systems use and because of other factors beyond their conscious control, they might not use systems as originally intended. There is a need to have a deep understanding of the problem areaâ€“users and the contexts they own. Therefore, in order to develop appropriate recommendations and guidance for users, developers need to understand how different persuasive strategies facilitate user engagement, social interaction and how the strategies can help to counterbalance factors that lead to the failure of digital interventions. Overall, the results reveal that integrating judgement and decision-making research explaining why people deviate from expected behaviour and software design patterns can help to improve the development and efficacy of BCSSs. An overview of my research is available from here . Current and Future Research My current research continues to investigate the design of persuasive and BCSSs and the broader impact of these digital interventions on end users and other stakeholders. Additionally, further planned research includes investigating how technology can be used to address problems facing the marginalised in society. For example, the homeless. Immediate plans for the former include investigating the role of self-regulation, users' need for cognition, goal attributes and user modelling on behaviour change. This is because users of BCSSs are not homogeneous, they differ in terms of their self-regulatory behaviours, their orientation towards goal setting and in the extent to which they engage in and enjoy difficult cognitive activities 1 . Because of these differences, users may require various forms of support and tailored persuasive strategies to help them fulfil their primary intent through a system. For the latter, the initial exploration of how technology can be used to address the needs of the marginalised is in collaboration with a colleague from Cambridge, United Kingdom. The research focuses on understanding the needs of the under-represented population in society, their experiences of service provision and the outcomes. Under-represented communities could include asylum seekers, low-income communities, those without access to financial services, those living in rural areas 2 and so on. The primary aims are to understand the needs of the marginalised and to determine how digital interventions are being used or could be used to meet their needs. J. Hamari, L. Hassan, and A.

I had planned to do more but wasn't able to for one reason or another. I ended up spending more time on one task than I should have. Now, many tasks are behind schedule and the approaching deadline is a bit too soon. If only there was a system to track and remind us of our own plans which we sometimes fail to meet! Sound familiar? A trivial example, perhaps but a pointer to the most basic of problems that technology can help us to address if only it is designed right. Whenever I am asked about my research, I often get a startled look when I say my research focuses on the design of persuasive systems. At first mention, it always seems like an alien concept plus persuasion and technology in the same sentence does not make for sound reading. At least, until I give an example of the systems, like social media sites, which we frequently use and have come to rely on for more than just regular day-to-day communication. These systems are inherently persuasive as their main aim is to get us to either share, inform, or learn from one another. They do that by providing interactive and engaging experiences that encourage regular visits. For example, how many times do we feel an urge to check a notification or decide to visit the social sites for a few minutes only to find ourselves still scrolling a while later? Persuasive systems design can make our behaviours more sustainable Computers were initially meant for simple tasks like calculation, retrieval, and storage of data. Through innovation they have become ubiquitous and embedded in almost everything we do. For example, it is now possible to independently and remotely learn (a new language or subject), monitor our health or wellbeing, become greener and more energy efficient, save money, overcome an addiction, and so forth. Persuasive systems are interactive systems that motivate change in users without the use of coercion or deception. These are systems developed to enable people to accomplish tasks they either would like to do or already like doing but don't have the requisite motivation for. Our lives are now increasingly intertwined with technology. Thus, studying how technology influences our everyday actions and how we can achieve positive and sustainable behaviour change through the use of these technologies is of utmost importance. Furthermore, with the many opportunities technology now avails, it is important to develop appropriate solutions that match users' needs and this is where persuasive systems design can help. The design of persuasive systems is user-centred, grounded in social psychological and environmental factors, and involves developing systems that meet the users' primary goals, facilitate interaction, are credible, and provide opportunities for social interaction. However, persuasive systems design is often driven by a rationalist perspective which often assumes that given clear instructions and if people are motivated, they will easily follow all the steps needed to meet their objectives. But research by Dan Ariely and others has shown that this is far from the case. We are \"predictably irrational\". Therefore, among the aims of my research has been to understand the role context plays in users' decision making. And to translate this understanding into the design of persuasive systems and behaviour change programs that users stick to. As Jodi Forlizzi stated in her keynote address at the persuasive technology 2015 conference, \"If we are in the behaviour change area, we need to have a deep understanding of the problem areaâ€”users and the contexts they own\".
