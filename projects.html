<p><strong><em>Co-innovation of digital rehabilitation in the global marketplace: 2022 - 2024</em></strong></p>
<p>Globally, it is estimated that approximately 2.5 billion people would benefit from rehabilitation, but most people do not have access. Especially in Low- and Middle-income Countries where the need for rehabilitation services exceeds availability. The World Health Organisation promotes rehabilitation as a key 21st health strategy and an integral element in achieving Universal Health coverage.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic showed the vulnerability of the present systems and the need for resilience and adaptability in changing environments. Joint action and research are needed to have feasible, appropriate, meaningful, and effective (digital) solutions that directly empower people to manage their own health, wellbeing, and rehabilitation needs in different contexts globally.</p>
<p>The project, a collaboration between <span class="caps">JAMK</span> University of Applied Sciences, <a href= "https://www.physiotools.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physiotools Ltd.</a> and <a href= "https://www.cse.fitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="caps">CSE</span> Entertainment Ltd was funded by Business Finland.</a> The overall aim was to create new business opportunities through evidence-based research on the use of digital-first rehabilitation in different service and cultural&nbsp;contexts.</p>

<h2>Urban Lifestyle Engineering</h2>
<p><strong><em>Healthier, happier and more sustainable cities: 2020-2021</em></strong></p>
<p>Urban planning and public services face a number of common challenges. New strategies and models are needed for future urban environments to better respond to human needs, environmental conditions and market dynamics. The project takes a human-centred and multidisciplinary approach to urban planning that is aimed at improving the delivery of services and the wellbeing and health of its citizens. This is by proposing the engineering of urban environments to promote sustainable and healthier behaviours and encourage socially inclusive practices. The expected impacts of the project are increased civic engagement, improved health of citizens, decrease in social exclusion and effective use of resources.</p>
<p>The project was supported by the <a href= "https://skr.fi/en/ajankohtaista/future-cities-boost-health-and-wellbeing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finnish Cultural Foundation</a> from the <a href= "https://www.podoco.fi/news/17-new-podoco-doctors-receive-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PoDoCo</a> foundation pool and is in collaboration with <a href="https://navico.fi/timo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timo Perälä</a> from Navico&nbsp;Oy.</p>

<h2>SEWEB</h2>
<p><strong><em>Sensors and social web: 2013-2014</em></strong></p>
<p>The target of the project was to create a basis for future health and well-being services by monitoring human ill-being and supporting behaviour change from an early age. By utilising the latest technology, we can monitor users in their everyday life by collecting sensor data for social web applications in real-time. The social web applications can also give feedback instantly (or even proactively), at very specific moments when users have made good or bad decisions affecting their health and well-being.</p>

<h2>Someletti</h2>
<p><strong><em>Social media in the Physical Space of Airports and Shopping Malls: 2010-2013</em></strong></p>
<p>The project examined seamless integration of social media systems to physical spaces, in addition to development of physical spaces with the help of feedback gathered via social media.</p>
<p>In the Web 2.0 era, so-called crowdsourcing principles gained great popularity in participatory design. It is important to understand when and under what circumstances this approach can effectively be used. In the project, methods and indicators that support participatory design were to be developed. These methods will enable users to genuinely participate to the development of new products and/or services.</p>
<p>The other research theme in the Someletti project was user persuasion. Especially, motivating customers to provide feedback about the physical facilities and services through new social and virtual channels, and to participate in the development of spaces and the virtual channels by using persuasive technology.</p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> My main tasks related to the project were the analysis of the persuasiveness of different social media platforms and comparison of the various platforms.</p>
